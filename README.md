# Overview

The freeRASP is available for Flutter, Cordova, Android, and iOS developers. We encourage community contributions, investigations of attack cases, joint data research, and other activities aiming to make better app security and app safety for end-users.

freeRASP plugin is designed to combat

* Reverse engineering attempts
* Re-publishing or tampering with the apps
* Running application in a compromised OS environment
* Malware, fraudsters, and cybercriminal activities

Key features are the detection and prevention of

* Root/Jailbreak (e.g., unc0ver, check1rain)
* Hooking framework (e.g., Frida, Shadow)
* Untrusted installation method
* App/Device (un)binding

Additional freeRASP features include low latency, easy integration and a weekly [Security Report](#security-report) containing detailed information about detected incidents and potential threats, summarizing the state of your app security.

The commercial version provides a top-notch protection level, extra features, support and maintenance. One of the most valued commercial features is AppiCryptÂ® - App Integrity Cryptogram.

It allows easy to implement API protection and App Integrity verification on the backend to prevent API abuse:

* Bruteforce attacks
* Botnets
* Session-hijacking
* DDoS

It is a unified solution that works across all mobile platforms without dependency on external web services (i.e., without extra latency, an additional point of failure, and maintenance costs).

# Usage

We will guide you step-by-step, but you can always check the expected result in the example.


## (Optional) Create a new Cordova demo application
Create a new Cordova project:

    $ cordova create hello com.example.helloapp Hello

Add platforms to your Cordova project:

    $ cd hello
    $ cordova platform add android
    $ cordova platform add ios

## Step 1: Talsec Cordova plugin prerequisites
### Android
Talsec Cordova plugin uses Kotlin, add following lines into the `config.xml` file in your project root directory.
```xml
<preference name="GradlePluginKotlinEnabled" value="true" />
<preference name="GradlePluginKotlinCodeStyle" value="official" />
<preference name="GradlePluginKotlinVersion" value="1.7.10" />
```

### iOS
Talsec Cordova plugin uses Swift, add following plugin to support Swift.

    $ cordova plugin add cordova-plugin-add-swift-support --save

## Step 2: Install the plugin

    $ cordova plugin add https://github.com/talsec/Free-RASP-Cordova.git

## Step 3: Setup the Configuration for your App
You need to provide configuration for Talsec to work properly. Use following format to provide configuration to the Talsec plugin.
```js
var config = {
    androidConfig : {
        packageName : "com.example.helloapp", 
        certificateHashes : ["your_signing_certificate_hash_base64"],
	// supportedAlternativeStores: ['storeOne', 'storeTwo'],
    },
    iosConfig : {
        appBundleIds: "com.example.helloapp",
        appTeamId: "your_team_ID",
    },
    watcherMail : "your_email_address@example.com"
};
```

Talsec configuration contains configs for both Android and iOS. You must fill all the values for the plugin to work. If you are not sure how to get your certificate hash, you can check out the guide on our [Github wiki](https://github.com/talsec/Free-RASP-Community/wiki/Getting-your-signing-certificate-hash-of-app).


If you are developing only for one of the platforms, you can leave the configuration part for the other one, i.e., delete the other configuration.

## Step 4: Handle detected threats
Talsec executes periodical checks when the application is running. To be able to receive detected threats, you need to provide listener to the plugin. The threat types are defined in the example bellow:

```js
var threatListener = function(threatType) {
    switch(threatType) {
        case "privilegedAccess": // Android & iOS
            // TODO place your reaction here
            break;
        case "debug": // Android & iOS
            // TODO place your reaction here 
            break;
        case "simulator": // Android & iOS
            // TODO place your reaction here
            break;
        case "appIntegrity": // Android & iOS
            // TODO place your reaction here
            break;
        case "unofficialStore": // Android & iOS
            // TODO place your reaction here 
            break;
        case "hooks": // Android & iOS
            // TODO place your reaction here
            break;
        case "device binding": // Android & iOS
            // TODO place your reaction here
            break;
        case "deviceID": // iOS only
            // TODO place your reaction here 
            break;
        case "missingSecureEnclave": // iOS only
            // TODO place your reaction here
            break;
        case "passcodeChange": // iOS only
            // TODO place your reaction here 
            break;
        case "passcode": // iOS only
            // TODO place your reaction here
            break;
        default:
            console.log('Unknown threat type detected: ' + threatType);
    }
}
```

Visit our [wiki](https://github.com/talsec/Free-RASP-Community/wiki/Threat-detection) to learn more details about the performed checks and their importance for app security.

## Step 5: Start the Talsec

Talsec can be started after the Cordova initialization is completed. 

The initialization should be done inside the `onDeviceReady` function in the `index.js`. 

```js
talsec.start(config, threatListener).then(() => {
    console.log('Talsec initialized.');
}).catch((error) => {
    console.log('Error during Talsec initialization: ', error);
});
```

## Step 6: Dev vs Release version
The Dev version is used to not complicate the development process of the application, e.g. if you would implement killing of the application on the debugger callback. It disables some checks which won't be triggered during the development process:

* Emulator-usage (simulator)
* Debugging (debug)
* Signing (appIntegrity)
* Unofficial store (unofficialStore)

Which version of freeRASP is used is tied to the application's development stage - more precisely, how the application is compiled.

### Android
Android implementation of the Cordova plugin detects selected development stage and automatically applies the suitable version of the library.

* `cordova run android` (debug) -> uses dev version of Talsec
* `cordova run android --release` (release) -> uses release version of Talsec

### iOS
For the iOS implemtation, it's neccesary to add script into the Xcode environment, that automatically switches between the library dev/release versions according to selected development stage. Then, it is necessary to embedd a symlink to correct TalsecRuntime.xcframework.

1. Add pre-built script for changing the Debug and Release versions of the framework:
   * Go to your **Target** -> **Build Phases** -> **New Run Script Phase**
   * Copy-paste following script:
        ```shell
        cd "${SRCROOT}/../../plugins/cordova-talsec-plugin-freerasp/src/ios"
        if [ "${CONFIGURATION}" = "Release" ]; then
            rm -rf ./TalsecRuntime.xcframework
            ln -s ./Release/TalsecRuntime.xcframework/ TalsecRuntime.xcframework
        else
            rm -rf ./TalsecRuntime.xcframework
            ln -s ./Debug/TalsecRuntime.xcframework/ TalsecRuntime.xcframework
        fi 
        ```
2. Place the new run script phase at the **top of the build phases**
   * Do clean build before change Debug <-> Release version
3. Add dependency on the symlink
   * Go to your **Target** -> **General** -> **Frameworks, Libraries and Embedded Content**
   * Add dependency (drag & drop) on the symlink on the following location:
     *MyApp/plugins/cordova-talsec-plugin-freerasp/src/ios/TalsecRuntime.xcframework*
   * If there is no symlink, try to create it manually by the following command:
   *     $ ln -s ./Debug/TalsecRuntime.xcframework/ TalsecRuntime.xcframework


## Step 7: User Data Policies

Google Play [requires](https://support.google.com/googleplay/android-developer/answer/10787469?hl=en) all app publishers to declare how they collect and handle user data for the apps they publish on Google Play. They should inform users properly of the data collected by the apps and how the data is shared and processed. Therefore, Google will reject the apps which do not comply with the policy.

Apple has a [similar approach](https://developer.apple.com/app-store/app-privacy-details/) and specifies the types of collected data.

You should also visit our [Android](https://github.com/talsec/Free-RASP-Android/tree/4dd5a41b33244c979de79bb3e16f9ccf167a948d) and [iOS](https://github.com/talsec/Free-RASP-iOS/tree/78dc848ef66c09438e338780ff46dda40efae331) submodules to learn more about their respective data policies.

# Security Report

The Security Report is a weekly summary describing the application's security state and characteristics of the devices it runs on in a practical and easy-to-understand way.

The report provides a quick overview of the security incidents, their dynamics, app integrity, and reverse engineering attempts. It contains info about the security of devices, such as OS version or the ratio of devices with screen locks and biometrics. Each visualization also comes with a concise explanation.

To receive Security Reports, fill out the _watcherMail_ field in [config](#step-3-setup-the-configuration-for-your-app).
